# smart_meter_data_analytics
This work performs data analytics on power data from households. The data is in a 15-minute resolution, and is from households in Switzerland as provided by a local utility company. There are four households, each with two separate smart meters. All households have a heat pump installed for heating purposes, which is measured by one separate smart meter. All other appliances are measured by the second smart meter. In addition to the smart meter data, we also load temperature measurements from a nearby weather station.
